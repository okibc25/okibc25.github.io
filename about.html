       <h1>HI, I'm Christina.</h1>
       <p class="about-project">Growing up in Michigan, I can remember staring accross Lake Michigan wondering what was beyond, hence my curiosity about the world, different cultures, and languages.  When I married the love of my life, we were able to travel the world together living all over the U.S. and Asia - 7 places in 10 years.
       The global perspective and orientation from years of travel has only enhanced my love for design and U.X. while fostering a curious open growth mindset.</p>

                <p class="about-project">Being a part of and giving back to my community has always given me great satisfaction as well as a sense of purpose.  For me, a part of giving back has always included working with children.  I truely believe that today’s youth will make a stronger tomorrow.  This is the reason that I am involved in projects such as “Project Cornerstone” where I children learn about core values such as responsibility, courage, honor, patience and integrity.   Along the way, I’ve realized it’s not me challenging children, instead it is them challenging me.  From their ideas, questions, creativity and fresh perspective children are our greatest hope for the future.</p>
