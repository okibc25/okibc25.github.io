        <h2 class="title">How might we empower public transit users by giving them accurate information.</h2>
         <p class="about-project">Inspired through real time travel exeriences, we sought to solve the user's problems by answering two simple questions:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>
            What bus is arriving next?
           </li>
           <li>
            How much time do they have to get to the bus stop?
           </li>

         <p class="about-project">There are several cloud based services currently accessible for personal and business use. Products such as iCloud,
           Dropbox, Google Drive and Pinterest seek to find the balance between the userâ€™s needs and wants. With this in mind, the challenge was to create
           a solution that eliminated frustrations and enabled better satisfaction over the current available options.</p>

         <h2 class="title">Competitive Analysis</h2>
         <p class="about-project">A competitive Analysis was completed to gather and understand the current market and user flows were created for each company analyzed.
           The analysis gave me a better understanding of the potential gaps as well as untapped opportunities within the market and any room for improvement.  From a design perspective
           the biggest takeaway was intuitiveness and an ability to collaborate. The companies analyzed were Dropbox, Pinterest, Google Drive and iCloud. Below are the SWOT anaylsis from
           two of the top competitors.</p>
