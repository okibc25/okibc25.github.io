         <p class="about-project">This project challenged me as I took on the role of researcher, copy, brand designer, ux designer as well as front-end designer.
         Each of these jobs had their own valuable learning moments, failures and successes. Not only was I in the trenches, I was able to experience seeing a project
         take shape through all the different design phases. Below are the different roles I filled for this project as well as the different deliverables and design tools
         used during this project.</p>

         <h2 class="title">The Challenge</h2>
         <p class="about-project">There are several cloud based services currently accessible for personal and business use. Products such as iCloud,
           Dropbox, Google Drive and Pinterest seek to find the balance between the user’s needs and wants. With this in mind, the challenge was to create
           a solution that eliminated frustrations and enabled better satisfaction over the current available options.</p>

         <h2 class="title">Competitive Analysis</h2>
         <p class="about-project">A competitive Analysis was completed to gather and understand the current market and user flows were created for each company analyzed.
           The analysis gave me a better understanding of the potential gaps as well as untapped opportunities within the market and any room for improvement.  From a design perspective
           the biggest takeaway was intuitiveness and an ability to collaborate. The companies analyzed were Dropbox, Pinterest, Google Drive and iCloud. Below are the SWOT anaylsis from
           two of the top competitors.</p>

    <h2 class="title">User Research</h2>
     <p class="about-project">This began wtih a survey that was sent out to social media contacts, friends, and peers to understand the users, the users
      needs and the users wants. The survey focused on the following:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>The specific cloud storage app/platform currently used.</li>
       <li>What do they specifically use the app/platform for - i.e. storage of photos, collaboration with others, or personal and professional use.</li>
       <li>What features about the app/platform is most valubale?</li>
       <li>What features about the app/platform doe they value the least?</li>
       <li>What features or capabilities would they values if added onto the app/platform?</li>
       <li>What are their current frustrations with the app/platform?</li>
       <li>What are the current tasks for which they use the app/platform?</li>
      </ul>
        <p class="about-project">Surveying almost twenty people, the data showed that 94% used cloud storage on a regular basis and over half use cloud storage on a daily basis.
         And of the 16 people surveyed, 66% provided feedback/recommendations on how to improve cloud storage.</p>
 </div>
  <div class="f">
    <img class="data" src="images/data.jpg" alt="data" />
  </div>
   <div class="g">
    <p class="about-project">Research showed that the frustration with cloud storage has to do with intuitiveness of the product.  The user wants the ability
     to interface with the product easily with the option of guided help or live support through phone or chat. Finally, the research showed that the cost of
     the service must be competitive in price with options for both the professional, personal or student.</p>
    <h3 class="sub-head">The Key Points:</h3>
     <ul>
      <li>Collaboration tools across multiple platforms</li>
      <li>Organization of data</li>
      <li>Ability to save photos, documents, and music across platforms into one location.</li>

       <h3 class="sub-head">Biography</h3>
      <p class="about">Susan is married with two grown children. She is a professor who teaches design thinking.  Susan loves to assign  work that draws her students together as team members.
       By forcing them to collaberate on assignments, she is teaching them about working in teams.  Susan is able to view the progress of the teams via the cloud storage system where her students
       are required to keep and share project information and data.</p>
      <h3 class="sub-head">Motivation</h3>
        <p class="about">
         Susan loves being a teacher. It is both her passion and profession; however, being able to track her students projects online, see who is contributing versus who is not is a must for any
         type of software and cloud storage that she uses.  There are also times that she needs her students to not only view large documents and files that contain both videos and images, therefore
         finding a cloud storage service that will allow a lot of data for little to no cost is a huge plus.

          users want to simply use cloud storage from either their mobile device or their home computer, as well as the ability to quickly accessing their stored documents from anywhere. This information
          gather as a part of the user testing will be utilized during the process of creating a more refined hi-fidelity wireframe in Sketch.</p>

          moment provided incredible value. This project gave me a perspective of the whole project from copy, research, branding, design and front-end development. The product went through three different iterations.
          This process enabled me to create a better product for the user, showcasing brand development, usability as well as simplicity throughout the whole design.</p>

        <p class="about-project">The process of designing a web based application, that is both simplistic and intuitive, revealed the amount of detail that the UX designer needs to possess. From surveys to usability tests,
          the ability to anticipate, understand, and identify the user’s problems effectively is a process that inspired and taught me more about the users needs.  Applying my knowledge of both the user and user’s needs,
          I gained a deep appreciation for both Apple’s IOS guidelines.  Ultimately, this process resulted in an improved prototype with better solutions for the user. </p>
