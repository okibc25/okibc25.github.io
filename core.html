      <h4>PHASE ONE</h4>
         <h1>The Challenge</h1>
         <p class="about-project">As part of the Research Team, our goal was to ask how might we find any gaps left by big-name market competitors in the cloud storage and organization market.</p>
         <p class="about-project">Once gaps were identified, it was essential that we build rapidly to create</p>
        <ol>

          <li>Define the user's wants?</li>

          <li>Build out any improved features.</li>
        </ol>

           the biggest takeaway was intuitiveness and an ability to collaborate.</p>

    <h1>User Research</h1>
     <p class="about-project">This began wtih a survey that was sent out to social media contacts, friends, and peers to understand the users, the users
      needs and the users wants. The survey focused on the following:</p>
      <ol>
       <li>The specific cloud storage platform currently used.</li>
       <li>What do they specifically use the platform for i.e. storage of photos, collaboration with others, or personal and professional use.</li>
       <li>What features are the most valubale?</li>
       <li>What features do they value the least?</li>
       <li>What features or capabilities would they value if added?</li>
       <li>What are their current frustrations with the app/platform?</li>
       <li>What tasks do they conduct on the platform?</li>
     </ol>
      <p class="about-project">Surveying almost twenty people, the data showed that 94% used cloud storage on a regular basis and over half use cloud storage on a daily basis.
         And of the 16 people surveyed, 66% provided feedback/recommendations on how to improve cloud storage.</p>

   <div class="g">
    <p class="about-project">Research showed the frustration with cloud storage has to do with intuitiveness of the product.  The user wants to:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Interface with the product</li>
      <li>Option of guided help or live support through phone or chat</li>
      <li>Cost of service must be competitive in price.</li>
      <li>Pricing options for the professional, personal or student.</li>

    <h3 class="sub-head">The Key Points:</h3>
     <ol>
      <li>1. Collaboration tools across multiple platforms</li>
      <li>2. Organization of data</li>

          the ability to anticipate, understand, and identify the user’s problems effectively is a process that inspired and taught me more about the users needs.  Applying my knowledge of both the user and user’s needs,
          I gained a deep appreciation for both Apple’s IOS guidelines.  Ultimately, this process resulted in an improved prototype with better solutions for the user. </p>
