         <h1>The Challenge</h1>
         <p class="about-project">As part of the Research Team, our goal was to ask how might we find any gaps left by big-name market competitors in the cloud storage and organization market.</p>
         <p class="about-project">Once gaps were identified, it was essential that we build rapidly to create</p>

    <h1>User Research</h1>
     <p class="about-project">This began wtih a survey that was sent out to social media contacts, friends, and peers to understand the users, the users
      needs and the users wants. The survey focused on the following:</p>
      <ol>
       <li>The specific cloud storage platform currently used.</li>
       <li>What do they specifically use the platform for i.e. storage of photos, collaboration with others, or personal and professional use.</li>
       <li>What features are the most valubale?</li>
       <li>What features do they value the least?</li>
       <li>What features or capabilities would they value if added?</li>
       <li>What are their current frustrations with the app/platform?</li>
       <li>What tasks do they conduct on the platform?</li>
     </ol>
      <p class="about-project">Surveying almost twenty people, the data showed that 94% used cloud storage on a regular basis and over half use cloud storage on a daily basis.
         And of the 16 people surveyed, 66% provided feedback/recommendations on how to improve cloud storage.</p>

    <p class="about-project">The process of designing a web based application, that is both simplistic and intuitive, revealed the amount of detail that the UX designer needs to possess. From surveys to usability tests,
          the ability to anticipate, understand, and identify the user’s problems effectively is a process that inspired and taught me more about the users needs.  Applying my knowledge of both the user and user’s needs,
          I gained a deep appreciation for both Apple’s IOS guidelines.  Ultimately, this process resulted in an improved prototype with better solutions for the user. </p>
