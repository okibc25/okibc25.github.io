       <h1>CORE</h1>
       <p class="about">Currently the market is saturated with cloud based services targeting a wide range audience.
         A cloud based storage service, Core places the power and control in the users hands while making the experience easy and affordable. </p>

         <p class="about-project">Core is a cloud based storage service with value placed on usability. Core’s efficiency allows the user to organize
           and manage content while collaborating with others. Core offers storage, content creation, real-time collaboration and visual organization.</p>

         <h2 class="project-name">The Challenge</h2>
         <p class="about-project">There are several cloud based services currently accessible for personal and business use. Products such as iCloud,
           Dropbox, Google Drive and Pinterest seek to find the balance between the user’s needs and wants. With this in mind, the challenge was to create
           a solution that eliminated frustrations and enabled better satisfaction over the current available options.</p>

         <h2 class="project-name">Competative Analysis</h2>
         <p class="about-project">To understand the current cloud storage market, this analysis gave me a better understanding of the potential gaps as well
           as untapped opportunities within the market and any room for improvement.  From a design perspective the biggest takeaway was intuitiveness and an
           ability to collaborate. </p>

        <h2 class="project-name">User Research</h2>
        <p class="about-project">I began wtih a survey that was sent out to social media contacts, friends, and peers to understand the users.
          Surveying almost twenty people, I found that 94% used cloud storage on a regular basis and over half use cloud storage on a daily basis.
          And of the 16 people surveyed, 66% provided feedback/recommendations on how to improve cloud storage.</p>
         <img class="data" src="images/Data.png" alt="Data"/>
        <p class="about-project">Research showed that the frustration with cloud storage has to do with intuitiveness of the product.  The user wants the ability
          to interface with the product easily with the option of guided help or live support through phone or chat. Finally, the research showed that the cost of
          the service must be competitive in price with options for both the professional, personal or student.</p>

          stored and shared, almost like a computer hard-drive. Based on research the brand needed to be trustworthy and simplistic.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-head">Typography</h3>
        <p class="about-project">Type is branding. Helvetica has a strong history within the design community and it was chosen to suppor the brand and identity of Core because of its
          openness, neutrality and symmetry.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-head">Color</h3>
        <p class="about-project">There is a high contrast between dark gray, light gray and white. This allows for better readability.  The primary color is color is blue to emphasize trust and
          loyalty. While the purple color was chosen because it positively affects the user’s attention and flow.</p>

        <p class="about-project">After completing the sketches with paper and pen, I walked some friends through the process after briefly describing the app.  What I learned showed me that most
          users want to simply use cloud storage from either their mobile device or their home computer. Quickly accessing their stored documents from anywhere. I moved forward with the results
          and proceeded to create a more refined hi-fidelity wireframe in Sketch.</p>
